            <h1>Case Study of a Permit System</h1>

            This tutorial examines a permitting system where demand from one substance moves into
            the other. This may help explore how multiple substances may interact with each other in
            the market.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                <p>
                    In the <a href="/guide/modeling_multiple.html">previous tutorial</a>, we both
                    introduced our simulation to multiple substances and to policies which can
                    manipulate across two substances. However, that prior policy didn't directly
                    model how demand might be changing in the market. For example, a permitting
                    system could cause pressure where some consumers of a refrigerant will move to
                    an alternative when permits become scarce. In this tutorial, we will tell our
                    simulation about how we expect demand may shift from one substance to another.

                <p>
                    We will express our permitting intervention as a policy which limits use of a
                    substance to a target. Go ahead and create a new "com permit" policy with the
                    following properties for HFC-134a set through the limit tab:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cap all sales to 98% from years 5 to 10.</li>
                    <li>Cap all sales to 95% from years 11 onwards.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This will model a permitting system requiring an annual reduction of 2% followed
                    by 5% for HFC-134a. Note that we won't yet introduce the idea of demand shifting
                    so please leave "displacing" as nothing. See the
                    <a href="#tutorial-gif-1">gif below</a> for a video demonstration of how to do
                    this step.

                <p>
                    Let's quickly take a look at what this policy looks like. Go ahead and make a
                    new simulation which shows the impact of this permitting system on its own. You
                    may also add this to the combined policy scenario. See the
                    <a href="#tutorial-gif-2">gif below</a> for a video demonstration of how to do
                    this step.

                <h2>Adding Displacement</h2>

                <p>
                    Right now, the permitting doesn't yet exhibit that pressure which causes an
                    alternative like R-600a to go up. We can change this by modifying the policy to
                    say that we "displace" into R-600a. After adding this into the permits policy,
                    go ahead and take a look again at the simulations to see how the two substances
                    are interacting with each other. See the
                    <a href="#tutorial-gif-2">gif below</a> for a video demonstration of how to do
                    this step.

                <p>
                    In this tutorial, we explored adding a policy into our simulations which
                    specifically considers how demand in one substance may impact another. In the
                    <a href="/guide/programming_reveal.html">next tutorial</a>, we take a look at
                    the editor tab.
