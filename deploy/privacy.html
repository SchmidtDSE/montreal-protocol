            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            This webpage respects your privacy and collects as little information as possible while
            still providing a positive user experience. By using the application, you agree to the
            following. Note that there is also
            <a href="#get-help">additional information about Get Help feature</a>.

            <section class="minor">
                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                This application records standard server access logs for security and stability
                reasons, including to prevent abuse. This is a common practice employed by many
                websites necessary for maintaing application function. This information includes:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        IP addresses which describe from which location and internet connection the
                        application is accessed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User agent strings which provide basic information about the device and
                        software ("browser") used to access the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The requested URLs which are unique identifiers for data and other resources
                        requested from our servers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                These logs are maintained for security reasons and to ensure strong application
                performance but are anonymized within 7 days of collection. These anonymized
                statistics are maintained indefinently as aggregated information for us to
                understand usage patterns in order to improve the service and maintain its
                performance. The anonymized data may also include error or bug reports. That said,
                and no other presonal identifying information is collected including email address,
                phone number, race, ethnicity, age, etc. Furthermore, please note that:

                <ul>
                    <li>Personally identifying information is never shared or sold.</li>
                    <li>Anonymized data do not include specific IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>
                        IP address is not retained past 7 days except for security / abuse
                        prevention purposes if potential unusual behavior is deteced like in the
                        case of a large number of requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>No information we collect is used for advertising.</li>
                    <li>
                        Though we do not ask users their age to respect their privacy, this webpage
                        is intended for those 18 years and older.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Finally, if technical issues are encountered, error reports may be sent back to us.
                However, we do not intend to collect personally identifying information through that
                mechanism. IP addresses and simulation code / configuration are not retained through
                these reports.

                <h3>Data Storage</h3>
                We save very limited data to your device and that data is not used to track you.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cookies are small text files saved to your computer to maintain data such as
                        preferences between website sessions. This application uses essential
                        cookies to support the core function of the application to, for example,
                        prevent showing explanatory text multiple times and improve user experience.
                        These cookies are required by the application to function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are no non-essential cookies for this application and cookies are not
                        used for tracking, advertising, or analytics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some browsers may save temporary copies of our data and code for performance
                        reasons through a process called "caching" which can be controlled through
                        your browser settings. This application may use "cache-busters" to inform
                        your browser when new versions of application resources are available.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Local storage may be used, for example, to save the application on your
                        computer to support weak internet connections or offline usage. This may
                        also be used to save your work between sessions though that work is not sent
                        back to us without your explicit permission.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                By using this application, you agree to the transfer of standard server access logs
                and anonymized statistics as described above to be transferred to data centers based
                within the United States of America.

            <section class="minor">
                <h3>Security and Access</h3>
                We take security seriously. Communication between your device and our servers is
                encrypted with secure socket layer SSL. Access to non-anonymized logs and the
                configuration / code for the application is limited to the current maintainers of
                the project, automated systems we've constructed for running the application, and
                our subprocessors. Note that anonymized data may be shared with project partners for
                the purposes of tracking project success and impact.
