            <h1>You Have Been Programming All Along</h1>

            This tutorial reveals that you have been programming throughout all of your engagements
            with the tool so far. We can use this understanding to craft bigger simulations.

                    Though it may not seem like it at first, you have actually been programming all
                    this time. In this next step, we will explore the code you already have written
                    and try making just a little modification.

                <p>
                    Remembering what you built in the first part of this tutorial, see how the
                    computer translated your substances and policies into code. Go ahead and open up
                    the "Editor" tab and see what you've written. This is a programming language
                    made just for Kigali Sim called QubecTalk. See the
                    <a href="#tutorial-gif-1">gif below</a> for a video demonstration of how to do
                    this step.

                <h2>Editing Code</h2>

                <p>
                    To familiarize yourself with the code, change HFC-134a recharge to 0.2 kg /
                    unit. To re-run your analysis, click the run button at the bottom of the screen.
                    Note that "default" means the logic executed regardless of policies enabled in a
                    simulation. Finally, go back into the "Basic" tab after you've made your change
                    and see if your change is reflected by trying to edit HFC-134a in the substances
                    list. See the
                    <a href="#tutorial-gif-1">gif below</a> for a video demonstration of how to do
                    this step.

                <p>
                    In this tutorial, we took a look at the code you had already written. In the
                    <a href="/guide/programming.html">next tutorial</a>, we will use the code to
                    grow the simulation substantially.
