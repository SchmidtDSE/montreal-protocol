        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
          In the <a href="/guide/interpreting_results.html">previous tutorial</a>, we explored the
          visualization tools available in Kigali Sim. This final tutorial
          demonstrates the full capabilities of the system through a comprehensive case study of
          ABC, a hypothetical medium-sized nation in the Asia Pacific region.
        </p>

        <p>
          ABC consumes four substances in manufacturing and servicing: HFC-134a, R-410A, HFC-32, and
          R-404A. This tutorial specifically builds a simulation from scratch in code, as opposed to
          earlier tutorials using the UI-based editor. This case study will show how to model
          complex scenarios involving multiple substances, applications, and policy interventions
          working together to meet international goals under the Kigali Amendment.

        <h2>Starting Conditions</h2>

        <p>
          Before exploring different potential futures, we start by detailing the current state of
          ABC by substance. These are based on averages of historic information.

        <h3>HFC-134a</h3>
        <p>
          HFC-134a is used across multiple applications with the following equipment populations and

          This substance is fully imported and there is no domestic manufacturing. 1,100 units are
          being imported currently per year. This has a GWP of 3,921.6 tCO2e. While not currently
          used in domestic refrigeration, MAC and chiller, this could be a replacement in those
          applications to HFC-134a with the same annual servicing frequency and retirement but 50%

          Note that when specifying units of equipment in manufacturing (or import) set points, 
          recharge will not reduce the specified amount. For example, setting manufacture to 100 units

          In addition to these high level trends, there are some assumptions specific to individual
          substances based on industry surveys. First, we anticipate 50% by weight of HFC initial charge for refrigeration
          equipment for alternatives. This leads to R-404A initial charges of 0.03 kg / unit for
          commercial refrigeration and 0.08 for domestic refrigeration.

        <p>
          First, for HFC-32, we expect growth in imports to grow by 100% linearly from 2025 to 2035
          without impacting R-410A across all applications. We will assume that this corresponds to
          an annual average percent increase of 7.18% per the CAGR formula. Also, unlike historic
          data, the simulation should expect 90% of the R-410A initial charge size. This means 0.90
          kg / unit for residential AC and 4.50 kg / unit for commercial AC for imports only.

          Next, moving forward, we will assume that HFC consumption will be a bit higher than
          historic values. Specifically, we will assume a 20% increase over the historic averages in
          HFC consumption. This should be reflected in starting conditions used in the first year of
          simulation. This is used to represent HCFC component of baseline.

        <h2>Policies</h2>

        <p>
          Policy options can be modeled individually or in combination to demonstrate how different
          intervention strategies would result in compliance or non-compliance with Kigali Amendment
          targets. Each option addresses different aspects of the HFC consumption cycle.
          Specifically, we will consider manufacturing prohibition targeting new equipment
          production, import bans controlling market supply of HFC-based equipment, and enhanced
          recovery/recycling reducing service sector consumption from existing equipment stock
          through recharge.
        </p>

        <h3>New Equipment Prohibition</h3>
        <p>
          Coming into effect in 2028, a full prohibition of domestic manufacturing of new HFC-134a
          and R-410A equipment. This leads manufacturing consumption of controlled substances to
          falls but servicing (recharge) continues for existing equipment. In this process, HFC-32
          replaces the new units lost that would have otherwise been manufactured by R-410A.
          However, nothing replaces the new units which are lost from HFC-134a.

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> If only a cap on new equipment but not recharge is desired, set the cap to units. This approach ensures that displacement occurs only for new sales (manufacture or import) minus recharge for existing units (priorEquipment).
          </p>
        </aside>

        <h3>Equipment Import Ban</h3>
        <p>
          Coming into effect in 2029, this policy would place a full ban on imports for HFC
          equipment. Instead, imports would shift to alternatives in R-410A and R-404A. These would
          be based on the application compatibilities of each substance. That said, recharge would
          continue for existing equipment.

        <h3>Enhanced Recovery and Recycling</h3>
        <p>
          Continuous starting in 2026 and increasing to 2029. Over these 4 years, recycling at
          recharge would go from 14% to 56% with 14% added each year, then drop to 40% from 2030 onwards.
          By adding code for this, we reduce recharge effectively to 60% of the original value once the policy is in full force.
          This policy assumes there is no induced demand from the recovered substances displacing sales.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          This comprehensive case study demonstrates the full capabilities of Kigali Sim in modeling
          complex, realistic scenarios. We have explored how to construct sophisticated models that
          include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Multiple substances across different applications</li>
          <li>Realistic business-as-usual growth projections based on economic data</li>
          <li>
            Targeted policy interventions including manufacturing bans, import restrictions, and
            recycling programs
          </li>
          <li>Complex scenario analysis combining multiple policies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The ABC case study shows how the simulator can support policy makers in evaluating
          different pathways to meet international goals under agreements like the Kigali Amendment.
          By modeling various combinations of policies, decision makers can understand the
          trade-offs and compounding effects between different intervention strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          This marks the end of our tutorial series. You now have the knowledge and tools to create
          sophisticated simulations that can inform policy decisions and help address global
          environmental challenges. We encourage you to experiment with your own scenarios and
          explore the full potential of this powerful modeling platform.
