            In this tutorial, we grow our simulation through code, exploring how we might be able to
            save time by interacting with our simulations through this alternative interface.

                <p>
                    In the <a href="/guide/programming_reveal.html">previous tutorial</a>, we
                    revealed that we have been writing code all along. That said, there are some
                    features of the engine which can only be accessed by writing code through the
                    "Editor" tab such as probabilistic simulation. Sometimes, it may also be easier
                    or faster to express your ideas through code than by building it up through the
                    dialog boxes. All that in mind, we will now make some edits through code.

                <h2>New Application</h2>

                <p>
                    Create a new "dom refrig" application for domestic refrigeration. First, have it
                    use "HFC-134a" with the following properties:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Initial charge 0.25 kg / unit for domestic manufacture</li>
                    <li>Initial charge 0.1 kg / unit for domestic manufacture</li>
                    <li>Assume emissions 1000 tCO2e / kg</li>
                    <li>A starting domestic manufacture level of 250 mt in year 1</li>
                    <li>A starting import of 50 mt in year 1</li>
                    <li>Increase manufacture by + 5% each year (the plus sign is optional)</li>
                    <li>Increase import by + 4% each year</li>
                    <li>
                        2% retired each year and 5% recharged each year with 0.05 kg / unit recharge
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Next, create "R-600a" with the following properties:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Initial charge 0.1 kg / unit for domestic manufacture</li>
                    <li>Initial charge 0.1 kg / unit for domestic manufacture</li>
                    <li>Assume emissions 50 tCO2e / kg</li>
                    <li>2% retired each year and 5% recharged each year</li>
                    <li>A starting domestic manufacture level of 5 mt in year 1</li>
                    <li>Increase sales by 5% each year</li>
                    <li>A starting import of 2 mt in year 1</li>
                    <li>0.01 kg / unit recharge</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Be sure to click "run" to execute again when you are done. Here is what that
                    code may look like right before end default:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-qubectalk">define application "Dom Refrig"

      initial charge with 0.1 kg / unit for import
      equals 1000 tCO2e / kg
      set manufacture to 250 mt during year 1
      set import to 50 mt during year 1

      change import by 4 % each year

      set manufacture to 5 mt during year 1
      set import to 5 mt during year 1
      retire 2 % each year
      recharge 5 % each year with 0.01 kg / unit

            <section id="new-policies">
                <h2>New Policies</h2>

                <p>
                    Next, let's make some policies. Create the following for domestic refrigeration:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Recover 30% with 100% reuse during years 2 to 20.</li>
                    <li>Replace 15 mt each year of all sales with R-600a during years 2 to 20.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Once again, be sure to click "run" to execute again. Here is what that code may
                    look like (right before start simulations):
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-qubectalk">start policy "Dom Recycling"

  modify application "Dom Refrig"

    modify substance "HFC-134a"
      recover 30 % with 100 % reuse during years 2 to onwards
    end substance

  end application

end policy



start policy "Dom Replace"

  modify application "Dom Refrig"

    modify substance "HFC-134a"
      replace 15 mt of sales with "R-600a" during years 2 to 20
    end substance

  end application

end policy

start simulations</code></pre>

            <section id="new-simulations">
                <h2>New Simulations</h2>

                <p>
                    Finally, let's modify our simulations so that recycle and replacement have these
                    new policies for domestic refrigeration. Note that policies are case sensitive.
                    Here's what that might look like:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-qubectalk">start simulations

  simulate "Business as Usual"
  from years 1 to 20


  simulate "Recycle"
    using "Com Recycling"
    then "Dom Recyling"
  from years 1 to 20


  simulate "Replacement"
    using "Com Replace"
    then "Dom Replace"
  from years 1 to 20


  simulate "Permitting"
    using "Com Permit"
  from years 1 to 20


  simulate "Combined"
    using "Com Recycling"
    then "Com Replace"
    then "Com Permit"
    then "Dom Recyling"
    then "Dom Replace"
  from years 1 to 20

end simulations</code></pre>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    Sometimes it is easier to use code to express your idea. However, many
                    simulations can be built either in the designer or code editor. Let's continue
                    our journey by looking closer at the visualization tools available in the
                    <a href="/guide/interpreting_results.html">next tutorial</a>.
