            <h1>Model a Single Substance</h1>

            This first tutorial walks through the process of defining and simulating a single
            substance. This is the foundational building block for any model built within the
            Kigali Sim.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                <p>
                    At the core of the simulation engine is the concept that there are multiple
                    applications that consume different substances like HFC-134a or R-600a.
                    Depending on your context, you can define applications broadly like all of
                    commercial refrigeration or more narrowly like commercial refrigeration in a
                    specific sector. After defining the system through these applications and
                    substances, we can then try out different policy scenarios on top of a "business
                    as usual" base case.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that this first exercise will start by building a small analysis. Don't
                    worry if this feels a little too elementary for your national context. We will
                    expand into more complex simulations as we go on. With that, start by opening up
                    the <a href="/" target="_blank">simulation tool</a>. Also, the numbers in these
                    tutorials are fake.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="first-application">
                <h2>First Application</h2>

                <p>
                    We will start by creating an application called "com refrig" which will be short
                    for commercial refrigeration. You can do this by clicking the add application
                    button.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, add consumption for a substance called "HFC-134a" with the following
                    properties in the general and equipment tabs:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Assume equivalency of 1000 tCO2e / kg.</li>
                    <li>Assume equivalency of 100 kwh / unit.</li>
                    <li>Initial charge 0.5 kg / unit for domestic manufacture.</li>
                    <li>Initial charge 0.25 kg / unit for imported equipment.</li>
                    <li>5% retired each year and 5% recharged each year.</li>
                    <li>0.1 kg / unit recharge.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We also need to set some starting conditions. We will make two setpoints in the
                    set tab:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A starting domestic manufacture level of 400 mt in year 1.</li>
                    <li>A starting import of 100 mt in year 1.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Go ahead and add a simulation called "business as usual" that runs from year 1
                    to 20. In the results section of the screen, try out a few different
                    perspectives. For example, take a look at how emissions play out over time or
                    how the equipment population changes over time.

            <section id="add-behavior">
                <h2>Add Behavior</h2>

                <p>
                    With this simulation in place, let's add some additional beahaviors. Go ahead
                    and edit HFC-134a and set some changes (use the change tab instead of the set
                    tab this time):
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Increase domestic manufacture by 5% each year in years 2 to 10.</li>
                    <li>Increase domestic manufacture by 3% each year in years 11 to 20.</li>
                    <li>Increase imports by 4% for all years.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This schedule will play out year to year based on the source of the substance.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    You built a model! In this first tutorial, we built the smallest possible
                    simulation. This includes just one application and just one substance under a
                    "business as usual" scenario without any policy intervention. In the
                    <a href="/guide/policy_single.html">next tutorial</a>, we will explore adding a
                    policy intervention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that, in this example, we are currently defining consumption through sales
                    volumes. However, your data may give you insight on the number of equipment
                    units currently in use instead. You can change from specifiying vollumes in mt
                    to units of equipment. In this case, the simulation engine will automatically
                    reverse calculations to determine consumption from equipment instead of
                    determining equipment by consumption.
