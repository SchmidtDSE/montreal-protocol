      This tutorial will open a pre-built simulation and use it as a motivation to explore different
      aspects of the visualization tools.

      <section id="motivation">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
          In the <a href="/guide/programming.html">previous tutorial</a>, we built out a permitting
          system and reviewed the results. Indeed, all of the sections of the guide so far have
          included some use of the built-in visualizations of this tool. However, this tutorial
          offers an opportunity to take a closer look at that section of the tool.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="open-sample">
        <h2>Opening the Sample</h2>

        <p>
          First, be sure to click "save file" at the top of the tool to keep a copy of your existing
          work. We will return to it later! After that file is in a safe spot on your computer,
          please click on the "open workshop sample" at the bottom of the page. This simulation
          continues what we started but adds multiple applications. Note that this will open code.
          Don't worry too much about that right now. Just click run at the bottom of the page.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="metrics">
        <h2>Metrics</h2>

        <p>
          We will start our tour of the visualization tools by highlighting the three metrics at the
          top of the screen. We can look at emissions that happen both during the useful lifetime
          and at the end of life for equipment. However, we can also look at consumption volumes and
          the size of the equipment fleet. Furthermore, after toggling between different metrics,
          various "sub-metrics" can be selected. For example, try opening emissions and selecting
          only recharge which would capture "leakage" given how much of the refrigerant needs to be
          replaced during servicing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="dimensions">
        <h2>Dimensions</h2>

        <p>
          There are different dimensions at the bottom of the page. For example, you can compare the
          emissions of all of the simulations or compare the applications under just business as
          usual. Specifically, you can also filter through your results by selecting different
          dimension values. In other words, you can look at these metrics across all simulations or
          just filter into a single simulation's results by selecting the radio button next to that
          simulation's name. You can do the same for different applications and substances.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an example, we could compare the outcomes of just commercial refrigeration by selecting
          com refrig under applications. We could even go further and select the com recycling
          simulation, the com refrig application, and then go to substances to compare projections
          of different substances within just that application within just that simulation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="dropdowns">
        <h2>Dropdowns</h2>

        <p>
          Finally, before trying out a few questions in this interface, note that there are also
          dropdowns within the chart region. For instance, on top of the chart it says something
          like "showing emissions summed by simulation scenario" which would indicate that the graph
          is showing the total emissions per year (across all applications and substances) per
          simulation. Modifying these dropdowns will update the rest of the tool's visualization
          section.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="business-as-usual-questions">
        <h2>Business as Usual Questions</h2>

        <p>
          Now that you have a sense for what is in the visualization section, we can answer some
          example questions about the business as usual scenario within this example:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            How much emissions in megatons (MtCO2e) are expected at the end of the simulation (year
            20) for business as usual?
          </li>
          <li>
            How much sales in kilotons (kmt each year) are expected at the end of the simulation
            (year 20) for business as usual?
          </li>
          <li>In business as usual, which application had the most sales?</li>
          <li>In business as usual, which substance has the most emissions?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Explore these questions by manipulating the results panel.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="policy-questions">
        <h2>Policy Questions</h2>

        <p>Next, let's compare different policy packages:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Which individual policy results in the lowest emissions?</li>
          <li>
            Which individual policy results in the lowest emissions from commercial refrigerants?
          </li>
          <li>Which substance is that policy mostly acting upon?</li>
          <li>Which policy results in the lowest levels of HFC-134a?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Which policy would you recommend?</p>
      </section>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          In this tutorial, we took a very close look at the visualization part of this tool. Now
          that we've mastered the visualization capabilities, we're ready to tackle a comprehensive
          realistic scenario in the
          <a href="/guide/case_study.html">next tutorial</a>.
