            This second tutorial walks through the process of defining a single policy that
            manipulates a single substance, demonstrating how to create multiple simulations.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                <p>
                    In the <a href="/guide/modeling_single.html">previous tutorial</a>, we built a
                    "business as usual" scenario describing a single substance and application
                    without policy intervention. In this next tutorial, we will simulate a recycling
                    program which captures and reuses refrigerant after a "yield loss" which is
                    substance lost during recovery.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="first-policy">
                <h2>First Policy</h2>

                <p>
                    Let's try this sample policy which recycles HFC-134a. Create a new policy called
                    "com recycling" which will be short for commercial recycling program. Let's have
                    10% recovery with 90% reuse for years 2 and onwards.

                <p>
                    Now, add another simulation called "recycling" which includes the commercial
                    recycling policy. This can be done by selecting the recycling policy checkbox.
                    Once again, please have this run from year 1 to 20.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you review the updated results, notice that the second simulation becomes
                    visible in the visualization of the results. In addition to comparing the two
                    outcomes, you can also use the radio buttons to zoom into just one simulation or
                    the other. Note that recycling is an option under consumption as a source
                    distinct to imports and domestic (virgin) manufacturing.

                <p>
                    In this second tutorial, we explored adding a policy into our simulations. We
                    also started to see how we can use this tool to compare different scenarios. In
                    the <a href="/guide/modeling_multiple.html">next tutorial</a>, we will expand
                    into multiple substances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that, while this sample policy only has one step, note that this schedule
                    can be used to model different phases of a possible intervention.
