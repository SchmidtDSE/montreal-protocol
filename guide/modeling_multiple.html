            This tutorial looks at expanding into multiple substances and explores how to combine
            different policies together.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                <p>
                    The first policy from the
                    <a href="/guide/policy_single.html">previous tutorial</a> only manipulates one
                    substance. However, some interventions may cause demand to shift from one
                    substance to another. Therefore, we will now introduce an additional substance
                    and explore a policy that replaces the existing substance, like through an
                    incentive program.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="second-substance">
                <h2>Second Substance</h2>

                <p>
                    We can define a substance which is used in multiple applications and multiple
                    substances which can be used in the same application. For now, let's stay
                    focused on commercial refrigeration but let's add consumption for a second
                    substance called "R-600a" that is used for commercial refrigeration (com
                    refrig). Assume it has the following properties:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Equivalency of 50 tCO2e / kg.</li>
                    <li>Initial charge 0.1 kg / unit for domestic manufacture.</li>
                    <li>Initial charge 0.1 kg / unit for imported equipment.</li>
                    <li>5% retired each year and 5% recharged each year.</li>
                    <li>0.05 kg / unit recharge.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Similar to before, let's also set some starting levels:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A starting domestic manufacture level of 10 mt in year 1.</li>
                    <li>A starting import of 5 mt in year 1.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Finally, let's add some expected changes: have both domestic manufacture and
                    imports increase 5% each year. You can do this by increasing all sales 5% / year
                    which applies to both imports and domestic manufacture.

            <section id="new-policy">
                <h2>New Policy</h2>

                <p>
                    Create a new policy called "com replace" that applies to HFC-134a. This time,
                    input the following schedule:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        10 mt / year of all HFC-134a sales to be replaced by R-600a in years 2 to 10
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        20 mt / year of all HFC-134a sales to be replaced by R-600a in years 11 to
                        20
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Now that we have this additional policy, we can build new simulations.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="new-simulations">
                <h2>New Simulations</h2>

                <p>After making this schedule, we will make two new simulations:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Create a new simulation called "replacement" which includes this replacement
                        policy on it's own.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a new simulation called "combined" which includes recycling and
                        replacement together.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    After adding these new scenarios, try to compare simulation outcomes within the
                    visualization section.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="files">
                <h2>Files</h2>

                <p>
                    We've built up some sophistication in this model. If you want to save your work
                    for later, be sure to use the save and load file buttons at the top of the page.
                    This also offers an archival format for your simulations which can be shared
                    with others.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    In this tutorial, we added a second substance and explored simulation of
                    policies both in isolation and together. In the
                    <a href="/guide/permits.html">next tutorial</a>, we will do a case study of a
                    permitting system which engages in some further sophisticated modeling of
                    demand.
