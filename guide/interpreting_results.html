            This tutorial will open a pre-built simulation and use it as a motivation to explore
            different aspects of the visualization tools.

            <section id="motivation">
                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                <p>
                    In the <a href="/guide/modeling_permits.html">previous tutorial</a>, we built
                    out a permitting system and reviewed the results. Indeed, all of the sections of
                    the guide so far have included some use of the built-in visualizations of this
                    tool. However, this tutorial offers an opportunity to take a closer look at that
                    section of the tool.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="open-sample">
                <h2>Opening the Sample</h2>

                <p>
                    First, be sure to click "save file" at the top of the tool to keep a copy of
                    your existing work. We will return to it later! After that file is in a safe
                    spot on your computer, please click on the "open workshop sample" at the bottom
                    of the page. This simulation continues what we started but adds multiple
                    applications. Note that this will open code. Don't worry too much about that
                    right now. Just click run at the bottom of the page.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="metrics">
                <h2>Metrics</h2>

                <p>
                    We will start our tour of the visualization tools by highlighting the three
                    metrics at the top of the screen. We can look at emissions that happen both
                    during the useful lifetime and at the end of life for equipment. However, we can
                    also look at consumption volumes and the size of the equipment fleet.
                    Furthermore, after toggling between different metrics, various "sub-metrics" can
                    be selected. For example, try opening emissions and selecting only recharge
                    which would capture "leakage" given how much of the refrigerant needs to be
                    replaced during servicing.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="dimensions">
                <h2>Dimensions</h2>

                <p>
                    There are different dimensions at the bottom of the page. For example, you can
                    compare the emissions of all of the simulations or compare the applications
                    under just business as usual. Specifically, you can also filter through your
                    results by selecting different dimension values. In other words, you can look at
                    these metrics across all simulations or just filter into a single simulation's
                    results by selecting the radio button next to that simulation's name. You can do
                    the same for different applications and substances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an example, we could compare the outcomes of just commercial refrigeration by
                    selecting com refrig under applications. We could even go further and select the
                    com recycling simulation, the com refrig application, and then go to substances
                    to compare projections of different substances within just that application
                    within just that simulation.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="dropdowns">
                <h2>Dropdowns</h2>

                <p>
                    Finally, before trying out a few questions in this interface, note that there
                    are also dropdowns within the chart region. For instance, on top of the chart it
                    says something like "showing emissions summed by simulation scenario" which
                    would indicate that the graph is showing the total emissions per year (across
                    all applications and substances) per simulation. Modifying these dropdowns will
                    update the rest of the tool's visualization section.

            <section id="business-as-usual-questions">
                <h2>Business as Usual Questions</h2>

                <p>
                    Now that you have a sense for what is in the visualization section, we can
                    answer some example questions about the business as usual scenario within this
                    example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How much emissions in megatons (MtCO2e) are expected at the end of the
                        simulation (year 20) for business as usual?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How much sales in kilotons (kmt each year) are expected at the end of the
                        simulation (year 20) for business as usual?
                    </li>
                    <li>In business as usual, which application had the most sales?</li>
                    <li>In business as usual, which substance has the most emissions?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Explore these questions by manipulating the results panel.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="policy-questions">
                <h2>Policy Questions</h2>

                <p>Next, let's compare different policy packages:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Which individual policy results in the lowest emissions?</li>
                    <li>
                        Which individual policy results in the lowest emissions from commercial
                        refrigerants?
                    </li>
                    <li>Which substance is that policy mostly acting upon?</li>
                    <li>Which policy results in the lowest levels of HFC-134a?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Which policy would you recommend?</p>
            </section>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    In this tutorial, we took a very close look at the visualization part of this
                    tool. Additional tutorials coming in the future.
